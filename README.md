# Storm Coding Exercise #

## Overview ##

The aim of this exercise is to learn about the Storm framework and then demonstrate this knowledge.

Information on Storm can be found [here](http://storm-project.net/ "here").  A good place to start would be the [tutorial](http://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Tutorial.html "tutorial").

This project contains a simple Storm topology that reads the contents of a local file, splits the text into single lines and then into individual words.  For each word in the file a line is written to an output file stating the word and the number of times that word has been previously seen.

## Tasks ##

1. Perform a code review of the application, noting any problems and describing any changes you would suggest to the developer. 
2. Describe some new features which could be made to extend this application.
3. Implement 1 or more of the new features you've listed.

## Notes ##

- We are not looking for a complete rewrite of the application for the code review. Focus on best practices and explain any potential defects in the code.
- Please do not fork this repository or submit answers as a Pull Request.  Test Responses should be submitted via email to your recruiter.
